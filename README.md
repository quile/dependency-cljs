# dependency-cljs

This is a (soft) ClojureScript port of Stuart Sierra's [https://github.com/stuartsierra/dependency](dependency) project.  It's a soft port because not all the tests pass right now, but on a bit of inspection the failures seem bogus.  Once I go back and fix the failures, it will be a more solid port, but from my POV right now, it's functioning correctly.
